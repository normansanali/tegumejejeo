Naturally, fans were intrigued with this rising actor and wanted to learn more about his personal life; especially his love life.</span></p><p><span>So, here we are exploring all about his baby mama, daughter, and dating life.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Jonathan Majors Baby Mama?</b></h3><p><span>As of 2021, Jonathan Majors’ baby mama lived in Atlanta with their daughter. Though he didn’t reveal her name, Jonathan made it clear that they were on communicating and had been co-parenting their then 8-year-old.</span></p><p><span>Back in 2020, Jonathan shared an interaction he had with his baby mother with </span><i><span>W Magazine</span></i><span>. He said that she called him to ask him to speak with their daughter, who was “frustrated” and “angry” because her hair wouldn’t “fall” and instead “goes up.”</span></p><p><span>So, Jonathan instantly hopped on FaceTime and told his daughter that she had a “crown” and that was why it went up. Also, he added, “Your hair, your crown, came from daddy, came from his mama, came from his father, came from his sister. Sometimes that crown can get you in trouble in this world, and it’s not right. And some people want to take that crown from you.”</span></p><p><span>This amazing dad will be making his feature film debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film </span><i><span>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</span></i><span> as Kang the Conqueror (Nathaniel Richards). His character is a fictional supervillain most frequently depicted as an opponent of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kang is a time-traveling entity and several alternate versions of him have appeared throughout Marvel Comics titles over the years, including his respective future and past heroic selves.</span></p><h3><b>What Has Jonathan Majors Shared About His Daughter?</b></h3><p><span>Jonathan Majors had his daughter in 2012; just before he went to </span><i><span>Yale School of Drama</span></i><span> for his graduate degree. Reportedly, he graduated from Yale in 2016.</span></p><p><span>As of 2021, Jonathan’s kid was 8 years old and old enough to learn about her cultural heritage. He wants her daughter, who is of mixed race, to understand that “it’s not ‘black history’— it’s American history.”</span></p><p><span>“The way it’s taught now, it’s honestly the Jim Crow system of separate but equal. We’ll give it one month, 12 pages in the history book…we’ll talk about Harriet Tubman, Rosa Park, MLK, then we’ll give you a little quiz about it. And that’s it,” Jonathan added.</span></p><h3><b>Is Jonathan Majors Baby Mama Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>No, as of 2021, Jonathan Majors didn’t seem like he was dating anyone.</span></p><p><span>Even during the COVID lockdown, Jonathan was quarantined alone in his New Mexico apartment with just his dogs. He revealed that he always “valued isolation.” However, it rubbed against his deep need for intimacy, making him admittedly talk to people on the phone longer.</span></p><p><span>But the actor didn’t reveal who was he spending long hours on the phone talking to. Could he be secretly dating? We’ve no way to confirm that.</span></p><h3><b>Is Jonathan Majors Gay?</b></h3><p><span>No, Jonathan Majors isn’t gay.</span></p><p><span>Like many actors whose sexuality is questioned, Jonathan became a topic after his appearance in the LGBT rights advocacy drama </span><i><span>When We Rise</span></i><span> (2017). His amazing portrayal of Young Ken Jones in over 4 episodes, had many believing that he was gay.</span></p><p><span>But he just could sink into the character, that turned his gay rumor mill.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>How Old Is Jonathan Majors?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Jonathan was born Jonathan Michael Majors on September 7, 1989.
