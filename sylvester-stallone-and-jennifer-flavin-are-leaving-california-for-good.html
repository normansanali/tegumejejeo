In the season two debut, Stallone announced that he was leaving California behind, venturing off to start a new chapter of his life in the state of Florida.</p><p>"After long, hard consideration, your mother and I have decided it's time to move on and leave the state of California permanently, and we’re going to go to Florida," Stallone told his daughters in the episode.</p><p>Stallone's wife, Jennifer, gave some clarification about the move.</p><p>"It’s an empty nest. I need to change it up," she said.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Yahoo</a>, "The “Rambo” star admitted he wasn't sure about ditching the Golden State, where the family has “a lot of roots” and where he got his first big acting break. He said moving to Florida is “not an easy transition” but he “gave in” to his wife's request for a fresh start."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don't want to shake things up, but I know my wife wants [a] big adventure," Stallone said.</p><p>In a confessional interview, Jennifer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to PEOPLE</a>, opened up about her daughters leaving home.</p><p>"I raised all three of our daughters in California. Everything’s a memory to me, memories of them not being there anymore. So I needed a big change, and Sly went along with it."</p><p>In the episode, the couple still needed to hash some things out regarding the move.</p><p>"This has great ramifications. Let’s say it doesn’t work out, now what? The house that we love that, we had built, gone," Stallone said.</p><p>"We can make new memories, new beginnings," Jennifer replied.</p><p>This is a major change for the duo, who are now back together after going through a public falling out.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar50016400.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Sylvester Stallone Is Releasing Tell-All Documentary After Nearly Divorcing Wife</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jennifer Flavin almost divorced Sylvester Stallone in 2022, and his new documentary may give more context on their near-split.</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stallone-and-his-wife-jennifer-flavin-were-able-to-reconcile-after-a-brief-split-and-have-a-new-chapter-to-look-forward-to>Stallone And His Wife, Jennifer Flavin, Were Able To Reconcile After A Brief Split, And Have A New Chapter To Look Forward To</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sylvester-stallone-looking-annoyed.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Parade</a>, the pair split near the end of 2022.</p><p>"Stallone recently covered a tattoo of Flavin with one of Butkus, the dog from Rocky. The tattoo artist who made the change posted a series of since-deleted Instagram photos of the process. Now we know why: Flavin filed for divorce from the Expendables star in late August 2022," the site reported.</p><p>"A month later, they filed an order of abatement, effectively putting divorce proceedings on hold. Stallone's <a href=# onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)" rel=noopener>rep told Pa</a>g<a href=# onclick="return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this,event)" rel=noopener>e Six</a>, "They decided to meet back up at home, where they talked and were able to work out their differences.

They have had lots of issues for years and she just had enough," a source told PEOPLE.</p><p>"He tends to do things on a whim without asking her before," another source said.</p><p>Stallone noted that he had to get his priorities right, something he struggled with.</p><p>"I used to have my priorities all screwed up, you know, work came first, and eventually, I came out of that delusional thinking, and they come first. So, you're right, to actually have them here, that's what it's all about," he said at the Tulsa King premiere.</p><p>Thankfully, the pair resolved their issues, and have been together since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They are now getting a chance to start over in Florida, which is entirely different from their current digs in California.
