He had been on the show since the beginning. But he decided to leave during Season Nine. <b>Production brought in actor Ken Curtis as Festus to replace the character.</b></strong></p><p>Regarding this, How was Kitty written off Gunsmoke?</p><p>See more ideas about miss kitty, gunsmoke, kitty. b. Buck Taylor as Newly or, Thad plays in it. Amanda Blake who played Miss Kitty took the loss so hard that she couldn’t handle continuing on, so she was written out of the show the year after that.</p><p>Then Why did Doc Adams leave Gunsmoke? For the whole 20 years the series was on the air from 1955 until 1975, he appeared in an impressive 605 of 635 episodes, according to IMBD. However, in 1971, he was forced to temporarily leave the show for just a handful of episodes because he had to undergo heart surgery after suffering a heart attack.</p><p>Did Marshall Dillon ever kiss Kitty?</p><p>Miss Kitty and Marshal Dillon kissed on TV in the late ’50s — but not on Gunsmoke.</p><p>Subsequently, Did they drink real beer on Gunsmoke? On Gunsmoke, the actors seemed to be drinking “beer” when they were drinking. Gunsmoke actors drank beer rather than whiskey, but they drank tea or colored water in place of whiskey.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_did_Matt_Dillon_have_a_daughter></span><strong>When did Matt Dillon have a daughter?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anyway, after Matt recovered, he went home — only to learn in the 1990 TV-movie “Gunsmoke: The Last Apache” that he and Mike had had a daughter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_was_Gunsmoke_filmed></span><strong>Where was Gunsmoke filmed?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the beloved TV show Gunsmoke takes place in the infamous Dodge City, Kansas, many of its outdoor scenes were actually filmed in southern Utah, just outside of the north rim of the Grand Canyon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_was_Doc_Adams_replaced_on_Gunsmoke></span><strong>Why was Doc Adams replaced on Gunsmoke?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>However, in 1971, he was forced to temporarily leave the show for just a handful of episodes because he had to undergo heart surgery after suffering a heart attack. To make up for the lost role, an actor named Pat Hingle replaced Milburn as a character named Dr.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_was_DOC_office_upstairs_on_Gunsmoke></span><strong>Why was DOC office upstairs on Gunsmoke?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>So the general stores and saloons and hardware stores and whatnot would have wanted to street-level spaces for their customers’ convenience. Professionals — lawyers or doctors or dentists or whatever — wouldn’t have had a much walk-in traffic, so they might have tended to take the upstairs rooms.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_was_the_mother_of_Matt_Dillon%E2%80%99s_daughter_Beth></span><strong>Who was the mother of Matt Dillon’s daughter Beth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Learned, who actually played Dillon’s romantic interest in a “Gunsmoke” episode years ago, plays Dillon’s former love and mother of their daughter, and Richard Kiley is Chalk Brighton, an Army Scout who is Learned’s die-hard suitor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_has_the_most_guest_appearances_on_Gunsmoke></span><strong>Who has the most guest appearances on Gunsmoke?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>But not of them crossed paths with Matt Dillon quite as much as Morgan Woodward. Woodward, whose mustachioed face illustrated the “Dirty Half-Dozen” article, guest-starred on Gunsmoke more than any other actor — 19 times, typically as the bad guy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_they_keep_beer_cold_in_the_Old_West></span><strong>How did they keep beer cold in the Old West?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>From the 1870s on, ice plants began to pop up in Western towns. For many years, brewers stored cold beer underground by cutting ice from frozen rivers during the winter to keep it cool during the summer. In 1873, pasteurization led to the widespread use of bottles for beer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_was_James_Arness_first_wife></span><strong>Who was James Arness first wife?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><th>James Arness</th></tr><tr><td>Spouse(s)</td><td>Virginia Chapman ( m. 1948; div. 1960) Janet Surtees ( m. 1978)</td></tr><tr><td>Partner(s)</td><td>Thordis Brandt (1965–1972)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Relatives</td><td>Peter Graves (brother)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_James_Arness_and_Peter_Graves_have_the_same_parents></span><strong>Did James Arness and Peter Graves have the same parents?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — Rolf Aurness, father of actors James Arness and Peter Graves, died Monday at the age of 88. Aurness, a rancher in Ventura County for 20 years, died at a Simi Valley hospital of natural causes, officials said.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_there_a_real_Matt_Dillon></span><strong>Was there a real Matt Dillon?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Matt Dillon is a fictional character featured on both the radio and television versions of Gunsmoke. He is the U.S. Marshal of Dodge City, Kansas, who works to preserve law and order in the western frontier of the 1870s. The character was created by writer John Meston.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Gunsmoke_filmed_on_a_soundstage></span><strong>Was Gunsmoke filmed on a soundstage?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Both utilized soundstage studio sets along with dramatic on-location shooting. Some significant episodes of both were shot almost entirely outside.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_was_Doc_office_upstairs_on_Gunsmoke></span><strong>Why was Doc office upstairs on Gunsmoke?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>So the general stores and saloons and hardware stores and whatnot would have wanted to street-level spaces for their customers’ convenience. Professionals — lawyers or doctors or dentists or whatever — wouldn’t have had a much walk-in traffic, so they might have tended to take the upstairs rooms.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Festus_become_deputy></span><strong>How did Festus become deputy?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Answer Man is also a big “Gunsmoke” fan and is fascinated by the sequence of events that made Festus a deputy. Truth is, Chester allowed Festus to become Marshal Dillon’s deputy because the actor playing Chester, Dennis Weaver, left to star in his own show.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_John_Wayne_offered_the_role_of_Matt_Dillon></span><strong>Was John Wayne offered the role of Matt Dillon?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>495), John Wayne was the first choice to play Marshal Matt Dillon, but he declined because he did not want to commit to a weekly television series. He did, however, recommend his good friend James Arness for the role and gave the on-camera introduction in the pilot.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_was_Festus_introduced_Gunsmoke></span><strong>How was Festus introduced Gunsmoke?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Technically, Festus Haggen was introduced the year before in the one-off episode “Us Haggens.” But it wasn’t until season nine that actor Ken Curtis became a regular part of the cast. Festus was perfectly suited to fill in as Matt’s funny yet dedicated right-hand man.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_was_Matt_Dillon%E2%80%99s_daughter%E2%80%99s_mom></span><strong>Who was Matt Dillon’s daughter’s mom?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Learned, who actually played Dillon’s romantic interest in a “Gunsmoke” episode years ago, plays Dillon’s former love and mother of their daughter, and Richard Kiley is Chalk Brighton, an Army Scout who is Learned’s die-hard suitor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Leslie_Nielsen_related_to_James_Arness></span><strong>Is Leslie Nielsen related to James Arness?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James Arness Brother Leslie Nielsen: Peter Graves Passes Away at 93.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Matt_Dillon_based_on_a_real_person></span><strong>Was Matt Dillon based on a real person?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The character Marshall Matt Dillon was modeled after the real lawmen such as Wyatt Earp (1848-1929) who tamed Dodge City. Dillon was laid-back, tried to avoid conflicts, and was tough when the need arose.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Matt_Dillon_have_a_daughter_named_Beth></span><strong>Did Matt Dillon have a daughter named Beth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Then comes the bombshell: Her daughter, Beth (Amy Stock-Poynton), is also Dillon’s daughter, the result of a romance 22 years before. By now, it must be obvious this is no ordinary “Gunsmoke” episode. This is a turning point in the life of Matt Dillon that will leave him forever changed.</p><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><h3></h3><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong></strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1kxKnFjJ2gnWWWmsC1wdJmqZ6onJawpnnCoZysrJWnerC6jKCsp6udpLimew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-festus-replace-chester-on-gunsmoke.html&text=Why%20did%20Festus%20replace%20Chester%20on%20Gunsmoke%3f%20%20Celebrity.fm%20%20%231%20Official%20Stars%2c%20Business%20%26amp%3b%20Peopl&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-festus-replace-chester-on-gunsmoke.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-festus-replace-chester-on-gunsmoke.html&title=Why%20did%20Festus%20replace%20Chester%20on%20Gunsmoke%3f%20%20Celebrity.fm%20%20%231%20Official%20Stars%2c%20Business%20%26amp%3b%20Peopl" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-did-festus-replace-chester-on-gunsmoke.html&title=Why%20did%20Festus%20replace%20Chester%20on%20Gunsmoke%3f%20%20Celebrity.fm%20%20%231%20Official%20Stars%2c%20Business%20%26amp%3b%20Peopl" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-festus-replace-chester-on-gunsmoke.html&title=Why%20did%20Festus%20replace%20Chester%20on%20Gunsmoke%3f%20%20Celebrity.fm%20%20%231%20Official%20Stars%2c%20Business%20%26amp%3b%20Peopl" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-festus-replace-chester-on-gunsmoke.html&description=Why%20did%20Festus%20replace%20Chester%20on%20Gunsmoke%3f%20%20Celebrity.fm%20%20%231%20Official%20Stars%2c%20Business%20%26amp%3b%20Peopl" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=next><a href=./who-are-sophie-kumpen-and-jos-verstappen-meet-max-verstappen-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Sophie Kumpen And Jos Verstappen?
