The romantic scene was with Wesley Snipes. J-Lo admits since she was new to the movie industry, she didn't want to be "difficult" to work with, so she didn't voice her concerns. She said, </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"When you first start working <a href=#>professionally</a>, you push the boundaries of what you should and shouldn't do, and I didn't think I had the right to say no, like, 'No, I'm not doing this, and that's it...' So we did it, and it was tough," she continued,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Wesley was wonderful about it in the sense that he was like, 'What's gonna make you more comfortable?' and I was like, 'Bring music, play it loud.'"</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The publication also reports J-Lo said Wesley tried to kiss her outside of filming. She said, </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Wesley–even though I had a boyfriend at the time–went full court press. He was flirting with me–you always flirt with your costars, it's harmless–then he just started getting a little more serious." She continued,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"He would invite us all out together and then at the end of the night, he'd drop me off last and try to kiss me. I'd be like, 'Wesley, please, I'm not interested in you like that.' He got really upset about it."</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wesley responded and said, "What happened was, she had never done a love scene before. She was absolutely terrified. I was given instructions from the director to make her feel good. That was my job." He continued, </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"I knew people would look at the screen and say either, "They have chemistry," or, "They don't." I told her, if she took my <a href=#>advice</a> we'd do a wonderful, erotic scene. And if it wasn't a good love scene, they'd edit around her and throw it on the floor."</span>https://www.instagram.com/p/CVJYbMRp6sR/?utm_medium=copy_link<a href=#><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Via</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTcm5nm5%2BifKm702alnq%2BjZLemus2inZ6qXaG8sbHZZqapnZ6oera8jJqZqK2kYsSmv8uesGarnp69pr%2BMramyoZ6cerW7jKSgrKtdnbKzedOoZKmqlaWus7GMn6arZZykw6Z50pycp51dnsFuw8CsZK2npZy1</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-lopez-opens-up-about-wesley-snipes-trying-to-kiss-her-to-prepare-for-love-scene-it-was-tough.html&text=Jennifer%20Lopez%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Wesley%20Snipes%20Trying%20To%20Kiss%20Her%20To%20Prepare%20For%20Love%20Scene%2c%20%27It%20Was%20To&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-lopez-opens-up-about-wesley-snipes-trying-to-kiss-her-to-prepare-for-love-scene-it-was-tough.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-lopez-opens-up-about-wesley-snipes-trying-to-kiss-her-to-prepare-for-love-scene-it-was-tough.html&title=Jennifer%20Lopez%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Wesley%20Snipes%20Trying%20To%20Kiss%20Her%20To%20Prepare%20For%20Love%20Scene%2c%20%27It%20Was%20To" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjennifer-lopez-opens-up-about-wesley-snipes-trying-to-kiss-her-to-prepare-for-love-scene-it-was-tough.html&title=Jennifer%20Lopez%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Wesley%20Snipes%20Trying%20To%20Kiss%20Her%20To%20Prepare%20For%20Love%20Scene%2c%20%27It%20Was%20To" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-lopez-opens-up-about-wesley-snipes-trying-to-kiss-her-to-prepare-for-love-scene-it-was-tough.html&title=Jennifer%20Lopez%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Wesley%20Snipes%20Trying%20To%20Kiss%20Her%20To%20Prepare%20For%20Love%20Scene%2c%20%27It%20Was%20To" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-lopez-opens-up-about-wesley-snipes-trying-to-kiss-her-to-prepare-for-love-scene-it-was-tough.html&description=Jennifer%20Lopez%20Opens%20Up%20About%20Wesley%20Snipes%20Trying%20To%20Kiss%20Her%20To%20Prepare%20For%20Love%20Scene%2c%20%27It%20Was%20To" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-tifford-net-worth-295449.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Tifford Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-joel-osteen-the-richest-pastor-in-the-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Joel Osteen the richest pastor in the world?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
