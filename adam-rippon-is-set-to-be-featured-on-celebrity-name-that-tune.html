Celebrities will have to predict song titles to win money for a charity of their choosing.&nbsp;Adam Rippon, a former Olympic figure skater with a net worth of $4 million due to his career as a figure skater, is one of the participants slated to perform on the program. Celebrity Name That Tune will debut on Fox on Wednesday, January 11, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><h2>Former Olympian to Take Part in Celebrity Name That Tune</h2><p>Adam Rippon, a former figure skater, and optimist will appear on Fox’s forthcoming musical program Celebrity Name That Tune. He’ll aim to predict more songs than Chris Jericho while raising funds for Pups Without Borders. The star was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to a family of five brothers. He had corrective ear surgery as a newborn when it was determined that he was largely deaf.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Adam-Rippon-1.jpg alt="Adam Rippon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Adam went to Our Lady of Peace Catholic Elementary School. After attending an ice-skating-themed birthday party at the age of ten, he began skating. His mother’s efforts in transporting him to Philadelphia twice a week for skating lessons paid off when, at the age of 11, he was cast in Stars on Ice to portray a young Scott Hamilton.&nbsp;From 2005 to 2007, the Celebrity Name That Tune candidate studied under Yelena Sergeeve. He earned a silver medal in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships while training with her. Following that, he won a gold medal in the Junior class at the Triglav Trophy in Slovenia. He also finished 11th in the 2006 and 2007 US Championships.</p><p>He won multiple additional titles throughout the years before relocating to Toronto in 2008 to train with Brian Orser. As his protégé, the figure skater won multiple additional medals, enhancing his image as a rising athlete.&nbsp;Adam Rippon was featured in Skating magazine in 2015. He married Jussi-Pekka Kajaala, whom he had been seeing since 2018, in December 2021. They met on a dating app in 2017 at a skating competition in Finland. In an Instagram post, the Celebrity Name That Tune competitor revealed his nuptials.</p><p>He stated:</p><p>“We’re married, surprise, surprise. JP and I looked at one other one day and stated the famous romantic phrase, “let’s just go do it now.” So that’s what we did.”</p><p>Adam told People magazine that the pair always wanted to do something modest and intimate for their wedding. He went on to say that he felt everyone knew they were going to do it and that no one knew whether they would receive a “heads up or not.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Adam-Rippon-2.jpg alt="Adam Rippon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>“We probably didn’t even realize we were giving ourselves a heads-up. We’re unpredictable, you know.”</p><p>Adam Rippon resigned from figure skating in November 2018 after winning a bronze medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The athlete won Dancing with the Stars season 26 with Jenna Johnson the same year.&nbsp;Since his retirement, he has been on various television series, including Will and Grace and RuPaul’s Drag Race, and he is now the co-host of MTV’s Messyness.&nbsp;He will now participate in Celebrity Name That Tune, which will air on FOX on Wednesday, January 11, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYnZmdYr%2BqvM%2BopWaho2LApsCMraZmmpVis6at066pnpxdpLtur8SlnJuqmanGbrrAppxmrJiWwW7A1KecaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fadam-rippon-is-set-to-be-featured-on-celebrity-name-that-tune.html&text=Adam%20Rippon%20Is%20Set%20To%20Be%20Featured%20On%20Celebrity%20Name%20That%20Tune&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadam-rippon-is-set-to-be-featured-on-celebrity-name-that-tune.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadam-rippon-is-set-to-be-featured-on-celebrity-name-that-tune.html&title=Adam%20Rippon%20Is%20Set%20To%20Be%20Featured%20On%20Celebrity%20Name%20That%20Tune" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fadam-rippon-is-set-to-be-featured-on-celebrity-name-that-tune.html&title=Adam%20Rippon%20Is%20Set%20To%20Be%20Featured%20On%20Celebrity%20Name%20That%20Tune" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fadam-rippon-is-set-to-be-featured-on-celebrity-name-that-tune.html&title=Adam%20Rippon%20Is%20Set%20To%20Be%20Featured%20On%20Celebrity%20Name%20That%20Tune" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadam-rippon-is-set-to-be-featured-on-celebrity-name-that-tune.html&description=Adam%20Rippon%20Is%20Set%20To%20Be%20Featured%20On%20Celebrity%20Name%20That%20Tune" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./daniel-may-obituary-death-visitation-funeral-service.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Daniel May  Obituary, Death  Visitation &amp;amp; Funeral service">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./james-gunn-explains-why-groot-looks-so-different-in-the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title>Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
