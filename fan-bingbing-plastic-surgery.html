Until her adolescence, images of her portrayed her as a person with a plump and round face. Her face, however, is said to have shrunk and become more angular since the start of her career.</strong></p><p><strong>Fan Bingbing</strong> is a Chinese <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>actress</a></strong> who was born on September 16, 1981. She was born and raised in Laixi, Yantai (now Qingdao). She attended the Shanghai Xie Jin Film and Television Art College as well as the Shanghai Theatre Academy. She was the highest-paid celebrity in the Forbes China Celebrity 100 list from 2013 to 2017, after ranking in the top ten every year since 2006. In 2017, she was named to Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people.</p><p>Fan began her career in East Asian cinema and television, most notably in the drama series My Fair Princess. Cell Phone, which was China's highest-grossing film of the year, was her breakthrough. She later appeared in several Chinese films, including Lost in Beijing, Buddha Mountain, and Double Xposure.&nbsp;Similarly, Stretch, My Way, X-Men: Days of Future Past, and Skiptrace are among her foreign film roles.</p><p>Plastic surgery on Fan Bingbing has recently become the most talked-about topic among celebrity viewers. People are talking about it because there are many before and after pictures on the internet that show her looking different. She is free of wrinkles and sagging lines in her forties. Did the Chinese actress have plastic surgery to enhance her appearance and prevent aging? Here is everything you need to know about Fan Bingbing plastic surgery.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>plastic surgery</a></strong> efforts of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Catherine Bell</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Trey Gowdy</a></strong>.</p><h2>Fan Bingbing's Plastic Surgery Rumors Explained!</h2><p>The first surgical procedure <strong>Fan Bingbing</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@bingbing_fan</a>) received was <strong>double eyelid surgery.</strong> It can be seen in her recent eye shape, which is more open and fresh than before. It is nearly impossible for other Chinese women to have such wide eyes if they do not have eye surgery.</p><p>Looking at Fan Bingbing's eyes, some people wonder if she has had Blepharoplasty surgery, as her eyes appear a little wider open than they used to. The double eyelid surgery makes her eyes look fantastic, with no squinting as seen the first time.</p><p>Another cosmetic surgery the Chinese actress may undergo is to correct her nose shape, which appears much more defined than it did previously. Her nose is now thinner and pinched at the tip. We believe Bingbing had a<strong> nose job</strong> based on the shape of her nose. Her new nose shape is very different from her old nose, which is bulbous and piggy. Overall, the rhinoplasty surgery has helped her to look more like a Western woman than a Chinese woman today.</p><p>The&nbsp;Lost in Beijing actress may also get a <strong>chin implant.</strong> This accusation is based on her face, which appears more oval than before. It should be noted that her <a href=# rel=noopener>face previously appeared rounded</a>, with a short chin. However, it appears longer and narrower now, giving her face a more oval shape.</p><p>Despite the fact that her breasts appeared to be pushed up, you can tell she had a reasonable boob size for a Chinese, especially for someone her height. Comparing her before and after photos, it appears natural, and there is no evidence of breast implants in these photos.</p><p>There has been no concrete evidence that the 41-year-old Chinese movie star has had any plastic surgery procedures done up until now, despite being caught in Taiwan in 2015 for visiting a cosmetic surgeon clinic. She has, however, denied any wrongdoing on her Weibo (China social media) and even posted photos of herself without makeup, clarifying that she was only there for a laser skin treatment to purify her skin on the recommendation of a friend.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Cell Phone star explained to a reporter outside the clinic that the laser treatment was for the removal of freckles or pigmentation spots. She now claimed that it was to make her skin fairer. However, a netizen claiming to be a clinic employee stated that Bingbing was there to undergo Ultrasound Lipolysis, a non-invasive treatment to remove fat deposits in order to improve body shape. Both Fan Bingbing and her manager denied the allegation.</p><p>On the other hand, the former My Fair Princess television series star may continue to remain silent about the circulating rumor. People are talking about it because there are many before and after pictures on the internet that show her looking different than other women her age.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>She is 33 years old and still looks wonderful and attractive. There are <a href=# rel=noopener>no signs of aging</a>, whereas some women her age have wrinkles on their faces. She probably had Botox injections. However, based on her current appearance, some people are convinced that the Fan Bingbing Plastic Surgery rumor is true.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGidmqZdl7avs8GipaBloKGutMDInGSsraKcsrPFjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffan-bingbing-plastic-surgery.html&text=Did%20Fan%20Bingbing%20Have%20Plastic%20Surgery%3f%202022%20Rumors%20Explained%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffan-bingbing-plastic-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffan-bingbing-plastic-surgery.html&title=Did%20Fan%20Bingbing%20Have%20Plastic%20Surgery%3f%202022%20Rumors%20Explained%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffan-bingbing-plastic-surgery.html&title=Did%20Fan%20Bingbing%20Have%20Plastic%20Surgery%3f%202022%20Rumors%20Explained%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffan-bingbing-plastic-surgery.html&title=Did%20Fan%20Bingbing%20Have%20Plastic%20Surgery%3f%202022%20Rumors%20Explained%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffan-bingbing-plastic-surgery.html&description=Did%20Fan%20Bingbing%20Have%20Plastic%20Surgery%3f%202022%20Rumors%20Explained%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./everly-tatum.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everly Tatum - Bio, Age, Height, Single, Nationality, Career, Wiki">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cody-strong-net-worth-136078.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cody Strong Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
