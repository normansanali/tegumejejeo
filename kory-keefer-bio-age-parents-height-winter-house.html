But in </span><i><span>Winter House</span></i><span> season 2, Kory Keefer was “kind of pursuing all of them!”</span></p><p><span>This Kory Keefer Bio explores his life.</span></p><h3><b>Kory Keefer On Winter House</b></h3><p><span>Kory Keefer joined </span><i><span>Winter House</span></i><span> for its second installment, all thanks to his best friend Craig Conove. The two have been friends for years. One day, Kory paid Craig a visit at the Winter House, and basically stayed there ever since.</span></p><p><span>Talking more about their friendship, Kory and Craig met as roomies and were even members of the same fraternity, </span><i><span>Kappa Sigma</span></i><span>, at the College of Charleston. Thereafter, the two “developed a bit of a reputation as the same guy, just in different bodies” and were practically “inseparable.”</span></p><p><span>As per Craig, he initially believed Kory would be alongside him when he was cast on the show. However, despite Craig’s attempts to convenience the producers that Kory would be a good match for Paige, they didn’t cast him.</span></p><p><span>Now talking about Kory’s time in </span><i><span>Winter House</span></i><span>, the guy was described as an “adrenaline junkie” who quickly becomes the “house heartthrob” in the house. He flirted with fellow newcomers Jessica and Rachel, as well as Winter House alum Ciara Miller, and this obviously stirred up some emotion for Austen Kroll.</span></p><p><span>In case you missed it, Austen and Ciara spent the last trip to Vermont romancing Ciara, and have hooked up on and off for less than a year.</span></p><h3><b>Is Kory Keefer Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>Kory Keefer is likely single as of 2022. Seem like that adrenaline junkie didn’t find a match in </span><i><span>Winter House</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for his previous girlfriend, she was heavily featured on Kory’s FB. From dressing up for parties to dressing off for a beach day, the two were inseparable.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t need #nationalgirlfriendday to celebrate my pearl,” he once praised his girl.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, the last post they made together was in December 2019. Guess, the lovebirds went on to break up in 2020.</span></p><h3><b>Kory Keefer Age</b></h3><p><span>Kory Keefer was 32 years of age in 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Kory Keefer Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Kory Keefer was born to his parents, Brian and Tracy Keefer.</span></p><p><span>His father, Brian worked as a pilot for </span><i><span>AirTran Airways</span></i><span>. While his mother, Tracy worked with her son at </span><i><span>Core 24 Gym</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Find them on IG — Brian @</span><a href=#><span>chief737</span></a><span> and Tracy @</span><a href=#><span>smilin4chief</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In 2022, Brian and Tracy were 56 and 58 years of age respectively. Also, they were married for 35 years then. Reportedly, they celebrated their anniversary on September 24.</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Winter House</span></i><span> star once featured his dad on IG, captioned, “Christmas with the old man.”</span></p><p><span>Also, on his mother’s birthday (i.e. on August 11) in 2016, he took to his IG to share, “Happy birthday to the most kind-hearted person I know! I am very proud to call you my mom. I Love you!”</span></p><p><span>As for Kory’s sibling, he has a 2-year-older sister named Karee K. White. She is a “Former Executive Director of Development – Strategic Relationships” for </span><i><span>Institutes at Furman University</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Karee married Wilson White on April 20, 2013. He was an agent at </span><i><span>Wilson White – State Farm Agent</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Kory Keefer Job</b></h3><p><span>Kory Keefer is a fitness enthusiast. No wonder, he went on to open a gym of his own named </span><i><span>Core24</span></i><span> in November 2013. According to their site, </span><i><span>Core24</span></i><span> has a New York underground club vibe, with Miami street art decor, and dirty south trap music.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, why did he choose the fitness industry? Well, Kory found his passion for fitness at his family’s gym in Seneca nearly two decades ago. Since then, he’s been involved in training programs.</span></p><p><span>Besides </span><i><span>Core24</span></i><span>, Kory also is the CEO of </span><i><span>Keefer Kardio</span></i><span> ever since Jan 2017, and the founder of </span><i><span>RAAD</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Prior to starting his own gym, Kory took a job as a fitness consultant at </span><i><span>East Shore Athletic Club</span></i><span> for almost a year.</span></p><p><span>Also, he tried his luck in sales, interning at </span><i><span>SIB Development & Consulting Inc</span></i><span> for 9 months.</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, he was also involved with </span><i><span>Culture Over Clout</span></i><span>, a filmmaking company. They charged $1500 for a 5 – 20 sec Video (5 still images), $2800 for a 25 – 30sec video (7 Still images), $3600 for 1 min Video (10 Still images and a 5-sec teaser), and $5300 for a 2 Min Video (15 Still images and a 10-sec Teaser).</span></p><p><span>As for Kory’s education, Kory attended the </span><i><span>College of Charleston</span></i><span> from 2008 to 2012 for his Bachelor of Arts in Communications degree.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b> <i><span>Core24</span></i><span> opened a new building in May 2015. On its 2nd opening anniversary, the star took it to his FB to share, “We could not have done it without all your help and support – I consider you all family.”</span></p><h3><b>Kory Keefer Height</b></h3><p><span>Kory Keefer stands tall at a height of around 6 feet 3 inches (190 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his distinct features, Kory has an oblong face, a rounded chin, and a ripped body.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>How Much is Kory Keefer Net Worth?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>&nbsp;Kory flaunted a net worth of above $1.5 million in 2022.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Kory Keefer On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>As of October 2022, find Kory on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>korykeefer</span></a><span> with 4.8K followers.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s his Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>kory.keefer</span></a><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Kory Keefer Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Kory celebrates his birthday in August.
