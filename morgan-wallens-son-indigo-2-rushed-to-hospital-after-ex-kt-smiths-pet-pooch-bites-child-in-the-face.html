The two-year-old child was bitten in the face and received stitches following the incident. However, Smith, assured her fans on Instagram that the toddler was recovering well and "he'll be okay" but might have a small scar as a result of the tragic occurrence.&nbsp;</p><p>Smith rescued the pooch, who is a Great Pyrenees named Legend, and stated that she and the dog "kind of saved each other" at that time. An emotional Smith detailed what exactly took place in a clip on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who is Cush Jumbo's husband?

She said, "Since then, we have been looking for options and I just couldn't bring myself to what everyone else says and what you're supposed to do, apparently - what the world tells you to do is to put the dog down because they are aggressive."&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who is Giovanni Capaldi?

"I know I don't want him to go to a kill shelter ... and shelters are full," she added.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>KT Smith asks fans for help</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>How did Janis Duski die?

She said that her pooch did not display any aggressive behavior before the attack. However, Smith acknowledged, that she could not keep Legend under the same roof as her son, as Indigo could be traumatized by the dog's presence following the attack.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/670ace64-dae3-4293-bb05-8d867ec1e422.png><p>Morgan's ex-fiancee said, "This will be all over the place and I'll also start off by saying I never wanted to bring this to social media, but he deserves better."&nbsp;</p><p>Smith requested her followers to help her find a new home for Legend in the wake of the accident. "I figured that I could ask you guys if you knew of anywhere that wasn't a shelter, because I don't think he deserves a shelter either because he came from trauma being left on the side of the road for months," she said. She also opened up about the dog's tendencies. "He doesn't walk on hardwood floors and he won't walk on leash, so he needs a yard," Smith said, adding, "Other than that he's not aggressive. He is great with other dogs. He just doesn't need to be around small kids that will possibly like, mess with his food or crawl on him."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e0bf5232-28fb-4ee1-b554-7ebd05613aa2.1426808974><p>Smith said Legend was around two, an "angel" and "a great guard dog." Smith also added that understands the need to find a new place for the dog before her son returns home. "I'm getting Indigo back home tomorrow and he has to be gone by then and I cannot put him down either because like I said he doesn't deserve that either. I can't be a good dog mom to him keeping a muzzle on him or a good mom in general having a kid just really scared of him in the home. He is not aggressive towards adults at all. You can get in his face and you can do anything and he’s still such a good dog," she said.</p><p>Smith said that she was able to find takers for Legend in a later update, describing the kind souls as "the sweetest family" who own a farm. "I couldn't have asked for a better family for him to be loved on by, and they're East Tennesseans, so we can visit any time we need to," she concluded.&nbsp;</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>What is Charlie Cox's net worth?
