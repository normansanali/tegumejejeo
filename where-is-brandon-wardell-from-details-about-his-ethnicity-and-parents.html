After he started doing open mics, he was invited to comedy hours in Washington DC, gaining his local popularity, which earned him invitations to play at SXSW in Austin, Texas.</p><p>In the spring of 2012, the comedian was scouted to perform at the Bridgetown Comedy Festival in Portland, Oregon, which eventually led him to be featured in The Washington Post in October of the same year.</p><p>Later in 2013, an agent from Los Angeles noticed Wardell through the Washington Post piece and approached him to be part of his team. He then agreed to the terms and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his career as a standup comedian.</p><p>The standup comedian toured with Bo Burnham in 2015 and afterwards became the host of a Snapchat series, Hot Takes on Comedy Central program. The comedian made his television debut in 2016 when he appeared on the Comedy Central show @midnight.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brandon-wardells-net-worth-as-of-2022></span>Brandon Wardell’s Net Worth As of 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The standup comedian has earned his fortune through various standup shows, television shows, and music shows.
