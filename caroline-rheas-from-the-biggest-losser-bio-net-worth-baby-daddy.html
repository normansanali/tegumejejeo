Rhea is perhaps still best known for her role as the quirky Aunt Hilda, in the sitcom “Sabrina the Teenage Witch”, which lasted from 1996 to 2003. Her other notable credits include “Man on the Moon” (1999), and a voice role in “Phineas and Ferb” (2007-2015), among many other differing accomplishments. Stay tuned for more information about Caroline, her life, career, and struggles before she became a prominent comedian. Let’s start from her childhood.</p><h2><span id=Caroline_Rhea_Bio_Early_Life_Parents_and_Education>Caroline Rhea Bio: Early Life, Parents, and Education</span></h2><p>Caroline is the daughter of Margery and David Rhea, who was an obstetrician and gynecologist. Growing up, Caroline shared everything with her sisters Celia and Cynthia. She went to an all-girls private school – The Study – in her hometown, then Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, and later the University of Arizona.</p><h2><span id=Move_to_New_York_and_Career_Start>Move to New York and Career Start</span></h2><p>After finishing her studies, Rhea moved to New York, feeling she had more opportunities there to launch her career. She started by performing in nightclubs such as Catch a Rising Star, then The Comic Strip among others, where she shared the scene with Chris Rock, Dave Attell, Louis C.K. and Marc Maron among others. However, it wasn’t that easy at the start, so Caroline also worked as a waitress for seven years before her big break. As her performances became more popular, she started appearing on TV; her first appearance was in “Half-Hour Comedy Hour” on MTV, and later she got her own show, “Caroline’s Comedy Hour”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/4ddfde2a-e831-4640-ae63-0368c676d356-troll-bride-1-24-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-24517407.jpg><h2><span id=Los_Angeles_and_Rise_to_Prominence>Los Angeles and Rise to Prominence</span></h2><p>Once she became known in the New York area, Caroline moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of an acting career. She began with minor roles, while in 1995 she secured her first recurring role, as Carol Green in the TV series “Pride & Joy”. It was in 1996 that she had her big break with the role of Hilda Spellman in the teen comedy-drama series “Sabrina, the Teenage Witch”, which aired on ABC from 1996 to 2003. During this time, Caroline enjoyed success not just as an actress, but also as a television host, and comedian. She hosted several shows, and appeared in a number of game shows, such as “The Rosie O’Donnell Show”, initially as a substitute for Rosie, and then after Rosie left the show completely, Caroline was given her own “The Caroline Rhea Show”.</p><p></p><h2><span id=Further_Success_and_The_Biggest_Loser>Further Success and “The Biggest Loser”</span></h2><p>“Caroline Rhea Show” lasted for one season only, but it was in 2005 that Caroline was named as the host of the competition show “The Biggest Loser”, in which contestants are obese people trying to lose weight, and the winner is the one who lost most pounds from the start of the show. Although she was the host for one season, her part on the show was memorable, but she stated that she would never host another competition show, as she feels that <a rel=nofollow href=#>all the drama is not for her</a>. Since then, she has focused on talk shows, and most recently another show of her own, entitled “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Caroline & Friends</a>”, premiered on the 16th July 2018.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy Birthday ⁦<a rel=nofollow href=#>@alekspaun</a>⁩ You big hunk. ⁦<a rel=nofollow href=#>@SherriEShepherd</a>⁩ <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/uD2vAbQ6Cq</a></p><p>— Caroline Rhea (@CarolineRhea) <a rel=nofollow href=#>June 29, 2018</a></p><h2><span id=Success_as_an_Actress>Success as an Actress</span></h2><p>Like many other comedians, Caroline found success in comedy films too, avoiding all the drama that doesn’t suit her.
