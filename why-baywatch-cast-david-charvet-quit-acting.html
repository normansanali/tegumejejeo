On top of that, there are loads of people who adore acting so much that they have spent years simply trying to make a living plying their craft without worrying about becoming famous. If any of those people made it big in the acting business, there is almost no chance they would voluntarily choose to leave stardom behind.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About What Baywatch's Original Cast Is Worth Today</a></span>Despite the long odds that any actor has to beat to make a living in the business, it is amazing to think that some <a href=#>famous actors have decided to leave show business</a>. In those rare cases, those stars have had their own reasons for quitting the acting business and some observers may harshly judge their decision. When it comes to one of the people who quit acting after previously starring in the show Baywatch, however, they had the best reason ever to leave Hollywood behind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-charvet-rsquo-s-years-in-the-entertainment-industry>David Charvet’s Years In The Entertainment Industry</h2><p>Born and raised in Lyon, France, David Charvet was blessed with incredibly good looks since he looks remarkably like Sebastian Stan. As a result, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that just like a lot of other <a href=#>famous actors who modeled</a> in the past, Charvet was able to make a living posing for photographs. Despite that, Charvet had something else in mind and he eventually set his sights on launching an acting career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Adam Levine & Other Male Celebs Who Pretty Much Only Date Models</a></span></p><p>After making his way to America, David Charvet wound up getting his big break in 1992 since that was the year he joined the cast of Baywatch. After debuting in the premiere episode of Baywatch’s third season, many of the show’s fans grew to love Charvet’s performance as Matt Brody. As a result, Charvet was a big part of Baywatch’s success for several years as he starred in the show up until the sixth season ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once David Charvet left Baywatch, he went on to enjoy even more success as he joined the cast of Melrose Place as Craig Field. Unlike Charvet’s Baywatch character, Melrose Place fans were supposed to hate his character in that show since he was a nepotism hire with a terrible attitude. Thankfully for every Melrose Place fan, Charvet did a great job bringing the easy-to-hate character to life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of David Chavert’s two most famous acting roles, he also popped up in several other projects including movies, TV movies, and shows. Still not through, Charvet spent years performing as a musician who was signed to a 5-album contract with Universal Music Group France.</p><h2 id=why-baywatch-rsquo-s-david-chavert-gave-up-acting>Why Baywatch’s David Chavert Gave Up Acting</h2><p>After years of success in the entertainment career, there was every reason to think that David Charvet would continue to get work for years to come. After all, Charvet remained as good-looking as ever and he had proven that he was a valuable member of two extremely successful TV show’s cast. Despite, that Charvet has barely acted since he left Melrose Place and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his last IMDb credit stems from 2013</a>. Similarly, Charvet decided to leave his music career in the past as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that it has been years since the show’s finale, many people want to know <a href=#>what Baywatch’s cast has been up to</a>. For example, since David Charvet has been out of the spotlight for years, many of his former fans have last track of him. In 2022, Charvet was interviewed by Page Six and he revealed how he wound up running a residential contracting company in Los Angeles called The Jones Builders Group which builds 10 to 14 houses a year.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebs Who Quietly Work A Regular Job</a></span></p><p>As David Charvet explained, he and his ex-wife Brooke Burke hired a contractor to build them a house but they became dissatisfied with their work. As a result, the couple fired the contractor, and with the help of a project manager, they oversaw the rest of their home’s build. Once their home was complete, Charvet realized he may have found a new career after visitors to the couple’s home asked him a simple question. “We finished the house, and every time that we invited people over … they were like, ‘My god this house is so beautiful. Do you think you could do it again?'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the aforementioned Page Six interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Charvet explained why he was open to starting a career outside the entertainment industry</a>, to begin with. “Before I had my first child I was traveling for five years in 42 countries doing concerts for my music. There’s no way I could do that again. I had to find a different meaning to my life. I didn’t want to go and take a TV show that was in Canada, I didn’t want to travel to Europe to do my music. I wanted to stay home and I wanted to be a good dad. I wanted to be there for my children every single day.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though David Charvet had a great reason to leave Hollywood behind, he was willing to admit it was hard on him to do so. “There was also a sense of sadness because I really loved what I did for 20 years. You know, there’s also an identity change which is something that for every man, I don’t wish for because when you lose your identity of what you knew you were for 20 years.” Knowing what Charvet went through to put his kids first makes his sacrifice all the more admirable.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About What Baywatch's Original Cast Is Worth Today</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdl666w8CtmqFlk5bAtXnDmq2inF2YtaK%2B1Z6rZqmlnsFurcKtoKefXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-baywatch-cast-david-charvet-quit-acting.html&text=This%20Baywatch%20Star%20Quit%20Acting%20For%20The%20Best%20Reason%20Ever&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-baywatch-cast-david-charvet-quit-acting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-baywatch-cast-david-charvet-quit-acting.html&title=This%20Baywatch%20Star%20Quit%20Acting%20For%20The%20Best%20Reason%20Ever" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-baywatch-cast-david-charvet-quit-acting.html&title=This%20Baywatch%20Star%20Quit%20Acting%20For%20The%20Best%20Reason%20Ever" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-baywatch-cast-david-charvet-quit-acting.html&title=This%20Baywatch%20Star%20Quit%20Acting%20For%20The%20Best%20Reason%20Ever" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-baywatch-cast-david-charvet-quit-acting.html&description=This%20Baywatch%20Star%20Quit%20Acting%20For%20The%20Best%20Reason%20Ever" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./this-place-rules-is-set-to-released-on-hbo-soon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Place Rules Is Set To Released On HBO Soon">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./toughest-scene-i-wrote-beasts-of-the-southern-wild-screenwriter-lucy-alibar-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Toughest Scene I Wrote: Screenwriter Lucy Alibar on Beasts of the Southern Wild">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
