She even broke down in tears after Cameron beat David Goffin to reach his first Wimbledon semi-final.&nbsp;</p><p>She previously gave fans a small insight into the relationship, confessing she wasn't initially interested in Cameron due to his travelling schedule. In October 2019, Louise lost her job - at the time, Cameron asked her to join him at the Vienna Open. "When he asked me, I thought, 'I guess this guy doesn't live a normal life, and it's not like I can meet (him) down the street and go to dinner together,'" she said. "So I went on this trip and was only supposed to be in Vienna for five days, and things just went really well…In some weird way, I was like, 'Thank God I got laid off when I did' because we were able to build the foundation of our relationship before Covid hit."</p><p id=e9hxWigPa6></p><p id=efgRbr45fm data-wc=18>There's no denying the wives and partners of Wimbledon players are integral to the narrative of the tournament.</p><figure class="videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff -recommended-video"><span class=videoPlayerStyleHeader_v1l4r7u3>Recommended video</span><span class=videoPlayerStyleTitle_v1pm0z4u>You may also like</span>WATCH: Inside Andy Murray's family life</figure><p id=eXlDBgEgVd1></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8eHyQb21uZ6eeuqO4xJ2mp2WnnsOmv4yapZ1loJa%2FtbrEq6po</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwimbledon-wives-and-partners.html&text=Game%20Set%20Match%3a%20The%20Wimbledon%20wives%20and%20partners%20revealed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwimbledon-wives-and-partners.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwimbledon-wives-and-partners.html&title=Game%20Set%20Match%3a%20The%20Wimbledon%20wives%20and%20partners%20revealed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwimbledon-wives-and-partners.html&title=Game%20Set%20Match%3a%20The%20Wimbledon%20wives%20and%20partners%20revealed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwimbledon-wives-and-partners.html&title=Game%20Set%20Match%3a%20The%20Wimbledon%20wives%20and%20partners%20revealed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwimbledon-wives-and-partners.html&description=Game%20Set%20Match%3a%20The%20Wimbledon%20wives%20and%20partners%20revealed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./greys-anatomy-recap-season-14-episode-23-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Greys Anatomy Recap: One of Our Own">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./emily-hillstrom-parents-where-are-they-from-does-she-have-a-affair-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emily Hillstrom Parents: Where Are They From?
