My mom's a screenwriter and before that she was an actress, and my father was an actor, my step-father was a director so I was on sets a lot as a kid. I loved the magic of the set. You walk in and it's a living room and you walk outside and it's just a piece of wood held up by another piece of wood. There's a lot of magic involved in movies that as a child I really appreciated."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyjmKynnmK5prXGoapmnpGptaa%2BjKygrKyVp3qlscCtn2abmJa7qLHDZquhnV2brrTAjK2gpp2jYq61edGim6CdnaS7tXnHop6hZaOprrO%2FjKWgn51dm7yzsdWeqWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-jason-leighs-father-sister-death-changed-the-fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-stars-life-forever.html&text=Jennifer%20Jason%20Leigh%27s%20Horrific%20Family%20Tragedies%20Changed%20The%20Fast%20Times%20At%20Ridgemont%20High%20Star%27s%20Lif&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-jason-leighs-father-sister-death-changed-the-fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-stars-life-forever.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-jason-leighs-father-sister-death-changed-the-fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-stars-life-forever.html&title=Jennifer%20Jason%20Leigh%27s%20Horrific%20Family%20Tragedies%20Changed%20The%20Fast%20Times%20At%20Ridgemont%20High%20Star%27s%20Lif" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjennifer-jason-leighs-father-sister-death-changed-the-fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-stars-life-forever.html&title=Jennifer%20Jason%20Leigh%27s%20Horrific%20Family%20Tragedies%20Changed%20The%20Fast%20Times%20At%20Ridgemont%20High%20Star%27s%20Lif" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-jason-leighs-father-sister-death-changed-the-fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-stars-life-forever.html&title=Jennifer%20Jason%20Leigh%27s%20Horrific%20Family%20Tragedies%20Changed%20The%20Fast%20Times%20At%20Ridgemont%20High%20Star%27s%20Lif" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-jason-leighs-father-sister-death-changed-the-fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-stars-life-forever.html&description=Jennifer%20Jason%20Leigh%27s%20Horrific%20Family%20Tragedies%20Changed%20The%20Fast%20Times%20At%20Ridgemont%20High%20Star%27s%20Lif" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kim-greist.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Greist">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jasper-restaurant-dead-body-was-of-verna-winn-a-woman-died-from-heart-attack-husband-and-family-456150-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jasper Restaurant Dead Body Was Of Verna Winn: A Woman Died From Heart Attack, Husband And Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
