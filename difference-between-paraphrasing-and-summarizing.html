Whether it is to improve their writing or understanding of complex material, understanding the difference between paraphrasing and summarizing can give them a boost. Let us explore the difference between them in the following article.</p><h2><span id=Defining_Paraphrasing_And_Summarizing>Defining Paraphrasing And Summarizing</span></h2><p>Paraphrasing involves expressing the same meaning of a text as the original author in one’s own words. It is important to use our initial understanding of the text, as well as contextualizing it, to write our paraphrase. Summarizing, on the other hand, involves condensing the text into a few sentences that capture the overall essence of the original text.</p><p>In the context of academic writing, both skills are equally important. Apart from helping comprehend the source material better, they also can act as complementary in various instances. For example, when writing a research paper, one can use summarizing to condense lengthy texts, while one can resort to paraphrasing to make sure that there is no plagiarism.</p><h2><span id=The_Role_Of_In-Depth_Knowledge>The Role Of In-Depth Knowledge</span></h2><p>When summarizing a text, it is important to have comprehensive knowledge about the author’s intent, along with the themes, audience, and any other form of contextualizing information. This step helps the readers to determine which pieces in the text are crucial, and which ones can be left out. Paraphrasing, on the other hand, is more linear and should adhere to the primary structure of the original text.</p><p>It is important to note here that the target audience is generally taken into account for both paraphrasing, as well as summarizing. The writing style may vary, depending upon the target audience, making sure that the text is comprehendible to them.</p><h2><span id=Knowing_The_Primary_Sources>Knowing The Primary Sources</span></h2><p>It is key to distinguish between a primary and a secondary source when trying to understand the difference between paraphrasing and summarizing. Primary sources are those that serve as the original source material, while secondary sources are those that comment upon said primary sources. While paraphrasing helps in understanding the nuances of the former, summarizing can be helpful to understand the latter.</p><p>In most academic arenas, summarizing is of paramount importance as it can improve comprehension further by providing an overall gist of the text. As paraphrasing is a more in-depth and direct exercise, it follows the text closely and helps one gain a more thorough understanding of the content.</p><h2><span id=The_Nuances_Of_Copyright>The Nuances Of Copyright</span></h2><p>When it comes to using the content of original authors for secondary works, it is important to abide by the copyright laws. Any use of ideas and expressions must be credited to the original author, in a way that does not breach the copyright laws. Paraphrasing and summarizing involve such use and it is, of utmost importance, that any related exercise be undertaken with care.</p><p>It is always better to properly cite the source material, instead of going overboard or missing out on something. This way, one can make sure that there is no infringement of copyright. Moreover, when done with care, it can also improve the readability of the text, along with the overall quality of the work.</p><h2><span id=The_Significance_Of_Both>The Significance Of Both</span></h2><p>When it comes to making sure that research and other academic writing is error-free and up to the mark, both summarizing and paraphrasing can prove to be invaluable. While summarizing can help to reduce the -length of the texts, paraphrasing is essential to keep the language and writing style intact. Moreover, it can also be helpful to make the work look more original and creative.</p><p>Summarizing helps to capture the main points of the original by using a few words, while paraphrasing helps to alter certain aspects to make the text look more creative, without losing any of the meaning from the original context. Both can thereby be seen as important aspects of writing, more so when it comes to academic works.</p><h2><span id=Polishing_The_Art_Of_Writing>Polishing The Art Of Writing</span></h2><p>Paraphrasing and summarizing are two important literary arts which can give a massive boost to any person’s well of knowledge. Not only can they help to acquire a thorough understanding of the source material, but they can also give a unique twist to the conceptualization of the same. By skilfully paraphrasing or summarizing a text, one can make sure that the writing becomes error-free and up to the mark in terms of quality.</p><p>In academic circles, honing the skills required for these arts can be of great help to students. They can gain richness of understanding by paraphrasing texts and deepen their comprehension by condensing them in the form of summarizing. All of this can come in handy when writing a research paper or preparing for certain examinations.</p><h2><span id=In_A_Nutshell>In A Nutshell</span></h2><p>To conclude – both paraphrasing and summarizing come with their own set of nuances and nuances. While paraphrasing entails re-writing a text in one’s own words, summarizing involves condensing the same in a few sentences. Knowing the difference between these two can help a student in his/her writing journey, both in terms of understanding the source material, as well as to improve the writing quality of a paper.</p><h2><span id=Summary>Summary</span></h2><p>This article has discussed the difference between paraphrasing and summarizing. It has been explored how paraphrasing helps to get the same meaning as the original text but in the writer’s words, while summarizing is used to condense the text into a few sentences. In academic writing, both are important and necessary for improving comprehension, avoiding plagiarism, and writing quality papers.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCwyJ%2BdnqqVo7CmecGeq7CdlaN6sa3RmqehqpGotq%2BzjJqlnWWjqrqurdGisaKml2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdifference-between-paraphrasing-and-summarizing.html&text=Difference%20Between%20Paraphrasing%20And%20Summarizing&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdifference-between-paraphrasing-and-summarizing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdifference-between-paraphrasing-and-summarizing.html&title=Difference%20Between%20Paraphrasing%20And%20Summarizing" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdifference-between-paraphrasing-and-summarizing.html&title=Difference%20Between%20Paraphrasing%20And%20Summarizing" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdifference-between-paraphrasing-and-summarizing.html&title=Difference%20Between%20Paraphrasing%20And%20Summarizing" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdifference-between-paraphrasing-and-summarizing.html&description=Difference%20Between%20Paraphrasing%20And%20Summarizing" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./do-shrooms-show-up-on-a-drug-test-what-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Do Shrooms Show Up On A Drug Test - What To Know?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./life-hacks-and-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrity Biographies">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
