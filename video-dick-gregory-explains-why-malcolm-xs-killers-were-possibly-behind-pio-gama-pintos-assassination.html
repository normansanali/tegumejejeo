When the paper was expanded and renamed PanAfrica, he became its editor-in-chief. In 1963 he was elected as one of Kenya’s representatives in the Central Legislative Assembly of the East African Common Services Organisation.</p><p>Pinto, on his part, had almost nothing to his name. His wife, Emma, was the family’s breadwinner. Their home in Nairobi’s Lower Kabete Road was a gift from an admirer.</p><p>After Pinto was assassinated in 1965, Emma was shocked to find that there was no money in the bank account to pay the rent.</p><p>He had reportedly been warned earlier that his life was in danger because powerful forces in government were unhappy with his activities, but he refused to flee the country.</p><p>He was shot as he drove out of his home and a certain Kisilu Mutua was arrested and convicted for the killing.</p><p>His assassination was the first in post-independence Kenya.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifLe1w56mZpyZmLhus9GenqiqqWKyubzLmqCnq12stbp5zJqjnKeconq5v4ykoKWklafAbsPEq5xmqJ%2BowKquy7Jkm52Ynrulec%2BipmafkaKubrzIp6uoq12WwLSt0qygp5mknryvew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html&text=VIDEO%3a%20Dick%20Gregory%20Explains%20Why%20Malcolm%20Xs%20Killers%20Were%20Possibly%20Behind%20Pio%20Gama%20Pintos%20Assas&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html&title=VIDEO%3a%20Dick%20Gregory%20Explains%20Why%20Malcolm%20Xs%20Killers%20Were%20Possibly%20Behind%20Pio%20Gama%20Pintos%20Assas" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html&title=VIDEO%3a%20Dick%20Gregory%20Explains%20Why%20Malcolm%20Xs%20Killers%20Were%20Possibly%20Behind%20Pio%20Gama%20Pintos%20Assas" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html&title=VIDEO%3a%20Dick%20Gregory%20Explains%20Why%20Malcolm%20Xs%20Killers%20Were%20Possibly%20Behind%20Pio%20Gama%20Pintos%20Assas" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvideo-dick-gregory-explains-why-malcolm-xs-killers-were-possibly-behind-pio-gama-pintos-assassination.html&description=VIDEO%3a%20Dick%20Gregory%20Explains%20Why%20Malcolm%20Xs%20Killers%20Were%20Possibly%20Behind%20Pio%20Gama%20Pintos%20Assas" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-cliff-harris-wife-karen-harris-everything-on-her-age-and-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Cliff Harris Wife Karen Harris?
