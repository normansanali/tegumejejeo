Avery Brooks’ contribution to&nbsp;</span><span>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</span><span>&nbsp;(1993-1999), where he directed the NAACP and Saturn nominated role played by Benjamin Sisko.</span></p><p><span>Brooks, who is also a singer, director, and theater professor in addition to his acting career, is also known for his roles in&nbsp;</span><span>Spenser: For Rent</span><span>&nbsp;(1985–1988) and&nbsp;</span><span>American History X</span><span>&nbsp;(1998), among others.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Avery Brooks Bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>Avery Brooks was born Eva Lydia (née Crawford) and Samuel Brooks on October 2, 1948 in Evansville, Indiana, to Avery Franklin Brooks.&nbsp;His father was a union representative and tool and mold maker at International Harvester agricultural machinery factory, while his mother was a choirmaster and music teacher.&nbsp;She wasn’t the only family member who could entertain people with her vocal cords, as her father, brother, and husband (Brooks’ father) were all singers, a trait passed on to Brooks.</span></p><p><span>Around the age of 8, after Brooks lost his father’s job, the family moved to Gary, Indiana for a better life.&nbsp;While his mother became one of the first African American women to earn a master’s degree in music from Northwestern University, he attended and graduated from Indiana University and Oberlin College.&nbsp;He later returned to Rutgers University, where in 1976 he became the first African American to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts and Masters of Fine Arts degree in acting and directing.&nbsp;The school further recognized him by making him associate professor of theatrical arts.</span></p><p><span>During his career as an educator,Avery Brooks performed in various plays throughout the ’70s.&nbsp;It wasn’t until Phillip Hayes Dean’s one-man play Paul Robeson in the early ’80s that he was recognized as a talented actor.&nbsp;Brooks received critical acclaim for his portrayal of the life of the famous singer, actor and civil rights activist, which he has performed across America and on Broadway.&nbsp;His foray into film and television acting came shortly after, when he landed the role of Hawk on the detective series&nbsp;</span><span>Spenser: For Rent</span><span>&nbsp;(1985–1988), and the rest became history.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Avery Brooks Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Some releases have estimated Avery Brooks to be worth around $60 million.&nbsp;Although we cannot authenticate the character, we are not surprised that he is considered so valuable thanks to his career as a television and theater actor and theater professor.</span></p><p><span>Thanks to his deep baritone, the Star Trek actor, NAACP Image Award-nominated and Saturn Award-nominated singer-songwriter for his performance on the series.&nbsp;He voiced the character of Captain Benjamin Sisko in the&nbsp;</span><span>Star Trek: Legacy</span><span>&nbsp;(2006) video game before beginning 2009 with the release of a spoken word album and a jazz and blues cover.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – wife, children</span></strong></h2><p><span>For over four decades, Avery Brooks has been happily married to his wife, Vicki Lenora Brooks (née Bowen).&nbsp;Not much is known about the couple, who exchanged vows in 1976, as Brooks has publicly stated that he loves to keep personal things about himself.&nbsp;What is known, however, is that Ms. Brooks once served as dean at Rutgers University.</span></p><p><span>Another well-known piece of informationThey have three children.&nbsp;Ayana, Cabral and Asante.&nbsp;The exact date of birth of the children is not known.&nbsp;In 1989, Essence Magazine gave his age as 9 for Ayana, 8 for Cabral, and 1 for Asante.&nbsp;If these numbers are correct, all of the Brooks children must have graduated from college and are earning a living for themselves.</span></p><h2><strong><span>height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Many people over the years have described Avery Brooks as being an imposing man.&nbsp;This is thanks to his height of 185.4 cm as well as other features that include a close cropped head and a mouth framed with a mustache and short beard.&nbsp;He also weighs about 86 kg.</span></p><p class=postsid
