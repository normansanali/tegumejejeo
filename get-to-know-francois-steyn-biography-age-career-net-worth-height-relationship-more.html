In July, he announced his retirement from professional rugby at the age of 36 and renounced taking part in the Rugby Championship and the World Cup in France.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>François Steyn’s Biography</h2><p>François Philippus Lodewyk Steyn born on 14 May 1987, is a South African former professional rugby union player who represented his country as a utility back, he was able to play as a center, fly-half, full-back, and wing.</p><p>Nicknamed ‘Frans’, Steyn began his professional career with the Sharks at the age of 19, finishing in the Super 14 in 2007 before moving to France in 2009 to join Top 14 club Racing Metro 92. After returning to the Sharks in 2012, he spent two years in Japan, playing for Toshiba Brave Lupus from 2014-2016.</p><p>Montpellier signed him after leaving Tokyo and spent four seasons with the French team before returning to South Africa, joining the Cheetahs in 2020 and retiring three years later. With 78 appearances for the Springboks and two World Cup winners in 2007 and 2019, Steyn is only the second South African player to win the World Cup twice and the youngest-ever World Champion.</p><p>He also won the Rugby (formerly Tri Nations) championship twice. Steyn was a powerful and versatile player, best known for his long-range shooting skills and his powerful one-on-one skills.</p><p>After playing just 10 games (at halftime) with the Sharks in the 2006 Curry Cup Premier Division, François Steyn was selected by national team coach Jake White to represent South Africa in the Northern Hemisphere Touring Team at the age of 19.</p><p>He made his wing debut against Ireland and scored a try on his debut. He was promoted to full-back for the next international match and scored a long-range drop goal from his own half, and has also shown to have good scoring skills.</p><p>Reaching his 50th test cap against Argentina in Cape Town in 2012, François Steyn is the youngest South African to reach the milestone. Steyn was injured during the 2012 Rugby Championship, missing the final 2 matches, along with the Currie Cup, and the end-of-year tour to the UK.</p><p>François Steyn was recalled to South Africa for the 2017 series against France after three years out of international rugby due to injuries to Pat Lambie and Handre Pollard. In 2019, he was called up again to the South African squad for Rugby World Cup Japan 2019, becoming one of 21 players to win the trophy at both tournaments and only the second South African to do so.</p><p>After four seasons in the south of France, François Steyn returned to South Africa and joined the Cheetahs on 1 July 2020. He made his debut on 10 October in a Super Rugby Unlocked match against the Pumas in Bloemfontein.</p><p>On 24 March 2023, he came off sustaining a knee injury in a Currie Cup Premier Division fixture against the Blue Bulls and was ruled out for the rest of the competition that his team won two months later. In July, he announced his retirement from professional rugby at the age of 36 and renounced taking part in the Rugby Championship and the World Cup in France.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>François Steyn’s Nationality</h2><p>François Steyn is a South African born in Aliwal North, South Africa</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>François Steyn’s Net Worth</h2><p>The actual net worth of Francois Steyn isn’t known but he’s reported to have an estimated net worth between $1 Million – $5 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where is François Steyn from?</h2><p>Francois Steyn is from Aliwal North a town in central South Africa on the banks of the Orange River, Eastern Cape Province. It is a medium-sized commercial center in the northernmost part of the Eastern Cape.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is François Steyn?</h2><p>Born on May 14, 1987, Francois Steyn is 36 years</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>François Steyn’s Height & Weight</h2><p>Francois Steyn stands 1.91 m tall and weighs 110 kg</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>François Steyn’s Career</h2><p>François Steyn started his career with the Sharks but moved to Paris after the 2009 British & Irish Lions trip and is now traded to Racing Metro 92 in France. He scored in the Super 14 against the Brumbies Ball at 100m.</p><p>After only a handful of games for the Sharks, Francois Steyn impressed the South African coach Jake White and he earned a call-up at only 19 years of age to the Springboks squad to tour Ireland and England. He made a try-scoring debut against the Irish at Lansdowne Road on the wing and after only nine Test caps he had already played at fullback, fly-half, center, and wing.</p><p>Francois Steyn, who scored the decisive drop goal in the 2007 Tri-Nations opener against Australia, was named to the World Cup squad later that year. Although he started on the bench in the tournament, he played as a substitute for Jean de Villiers, who was injured in the first match against Samoa.</p><p>Later in the tournament, when the Springboks faced Tonga in the physical group stage, he and opposing winger Joseph Vaka were embroiled in controversy. Steyn allegedly bit a Pacific Islander, but the Tongan failed to produce enough evidence to convict him, so Steyn was allowed to play in the remainder of the tournament. Francois Steyn scored four penalties and a try as South Africa beat England 15-6 in the final at the Stade de France in Paris.</p><p>He was named to the Laureus World of the Year Team in 2008 but made only two starts for the Springboks. The following year, he was given the opportunity to play fullback against the British & Irish Lions, scoring penalties in each of the first two Tests as the Springboks won both games to clinch the series title. He came on as a substitute in the third Test as the Lions were relegated.</p><p>Francois Steyn was sidelined in the summer of 2010 following an allegation of a feud with Springboks manager Peter de Villiers but was recalled after the team lost their first three games with the Tri-Nations. After a great start to the 2010/11 season with Racing Metro, Steyn has been called up to the Box team for international competition in the autumn. De Villiers chose to start a versatile player in midfield.</p><p>Towards the end of the season, Steyn struggled with injuries and was part of the ‘Rustenburg 21’, group of players who left Boks and sat out of the Tri Nations Tour. He was called up for the match against Australia on 13 August and played 50 minutes before being replaced by Gio Apron. After the match, however, it was announced that Steyn had suffered a hamstring injury and would miss the test against the All Blacks on 20 August.</p><p>He recovered well in time for the World Cup but suffered a shoulder injury in the final group game against Samoa, which kept him out of the rest of the tournament. Steyn returned to Racing Metro for the 2011/12 season and played a key role in the season. However, in April 2012, Stein announced that he would leave the Paris side at the end of the campaign and return to South Africa.</p><p>In July, he announced his retirement from professional rugby at the age of 36 and renounced taking part in the Rugby Championship and the World Cup in France.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>François Steyn’s Marital Status</h2><p>Francois Steyn is married and got married to Linca Meyer in Durban in June 2012. She was born and raised in Free State South Africa and relocated to Durban, where she met the love of her life.</p><p>Linca Meyer is reportedly not related to Heyneke Meyer a professional rugby union coach, best known for coaching the Springboks from 2012 until 2015.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>François Steyn’s Family & Siblings</h2><p>Francois Steyn is the son of Marcia Steyn and Piet Steyn but there is no information about what they do for a living or whether he has any siblings or not.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is François Steyn famous?</h2><p>Francois Steyn is famous as a two-time South African rugby winner who was instrumental in winning South Africa’s third Rugby World Cup in 2019. This victory made him just the second South African to win the game’s biggest tournament as he followed in the footsteps of 1995 and 2007 champion Os Du Randt.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>François Steyn’s Children</h2><p>Francois Steyn is said to have three daughters but there is no information about the girls hence we don’t know their names or age.
