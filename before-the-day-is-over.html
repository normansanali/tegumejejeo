The use of the phrase, "Things changing course" highlights the idea of sudden changes that may alter one's perspective and push them further away from achieving what they want. The following lines emphasize the notion of time slipping away, leaving no room for second chances. The repetition of "And I was hopin', and I was hopin' this time" conveys the sense of desperation that the singer feels, hoping for a good outcome that doesn't seem likely.</p><br><p>The second verse of the song focuses on the regret of not being able to fully appreciate a moment of happiness during a time when it was available. The lines, "Don't hold your tongue, there's no time for tricks. You've been closing up, I expected this" suggests that the singer has been fighting with a partner or a loved one, trying to keep them open and communicative. It is suggested that this hasn't happened, and that this lack of communication could be the reason for the almost-lost moment. The repeated line, "I know it won't be long, I know you're almost gone," is a powerful reminder of the time-sensitive nature of the situation. It conveys the singer's fear of losing the opportunity to make things right before it's too late.</p><br><p>The chorus of the song focuses on the plea for help to mend a broken relationship. The repeated sentiment of "let me in before the day is over" is a desperate plea, which suggests that the singer will do anything to fix the situation before it's too late. This plea for help is repeated until the end of the song, driving the importance of the moment home.</p><br><p>Overall, "Before The Day Is Over" is a deeply emotional song that speaks to the fear of missed opportunities, the regret of lost happiness, and the desperate need for reconciliation when things have gone wrong.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I don't know what you wanna hear</u><br>I am unsure of the words you wish to listen to</p><br><p><u>Things changing course, smiles fade to grin</u><br>Situations are altering, happiness turns to forced smiles</p><br><p><u>Now the moment's gone, just as I feared</u><br>The time has slipped away, just as I anticipated</p><br><p><u>And I was hopin', and I was hopin' this time</u><br>I was optimistic, I was optimistic this time</p><br><p><u>No longer here, we were feeling bliss</u><br>The delight we once felt is no longer present</p><br><p><u>Don't hold your tongue, there's no time for tricks</u><br>Do not remain silent, there is no time for deceit</p><br><p><u>You've been closing up, I expected this</u><br>You have been shutting down, I predicted this</p><br><p><u>But I was hopin' that you'd stay open this time</u><br>However, I was optimistic that you would remain receptive this time</p><br><p><u>Say something soon, we might lose it all</u><br>Communiate quickly, we may lose everything</p><br><p><u>Something we can use to break our fall</u><br>Something to use as a safety net if we trip</p><br><p><u>There's nothing left to do when we start to stall</u><br>We are out of options when we begin to falter</p><br><p><u>And I was hopin' that we could hold it this time</u><br>Furthermore, I had hoped that we could sustain this time</p><br><p><u>Let me in, let me in</u><br>Permit me to gain entry</p><br><p><u>Just let me in before the day is over</u><br>Simply admit me before the day is finished</p><br><p><u>(I can't take another day)</u><br>(I cannot endure another day)</p><br><p><u>(I could go insane)</u><br>(I could lose my mind)</p><br><p><u>(There's only so much I can take)</u><br>(I have a threshold)</p><br><p><u>(I can't live this way)</u><br>(I cannot continue to exist like this)</p><br><p><u>Let me in, let me in (I know it won't be long)</u><br>Permit me to gain entry (I am aware that time is limited)</p><br><p><u>Just let me in before the day is over (I know you're almost gone)</u><br>Simply admit me before the day is finished (I understand that you are nearly gone)</p><br><p><u>Let me in, let me in</u><br>Permit me to gain entry</p><br><p><u>Just let me in before the day is over</u><br>Simply admit me before the day is finished</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © CONCORD MUSIC PUBLISHING LLC, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.<br>Written by: Joji Kusunoki, Justin Parker, Samuel Joseph Dew</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maKKfn7ZwrsSfpqudj6m1pqvDmrCYoaOUvLex0Q%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbefore-the-day-is-over.html&text=before%20the%20day%20is%20over&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbefore-the-day-is-over.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbefore-the-day-is-over.html&title=before%20the%20day%20is%20over" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbefore-the-day-is-over.html&title=before%20the%20day%20is%20over" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbefore-the-day-is-over.html&title=before%20the%20day%20is%20over" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbefore-the-day-is-over.html&description=before%20the%20day%20is%20over" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./billy-nolan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-277558-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billy Nolan Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
