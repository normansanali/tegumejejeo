Us'</h2><p>Arguably as senseless as the killings of dolphins is the industrial butchery of sharks for their fins.</p><p>This is to satisfy the demand for shark fin soup in China and other Asian countries, where a single bowl in a restaurant can go for over $100.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644408582.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644408580.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644408581.jpg><p>And the effect that demand for the soup - which is seen as a status symbol - has on shark populations is devastating: 86 per cent of the world's bull sharks and 99 per cent of scalloped hammerheads have been wiped out in the last 50 years.</p><p>This isn't just a problem for sharks.</p><p>"If these sharks get finned into extinction, the ocean’s going to turn into a swamp," says Paul De Gelder, a shark attack survivor who lost a hand and leg to a bull shark, and has now become an unlikely advocate for the predators.</p><p>"And guess who’s going to die next?

They’re just trying to catch every last little bit of whatever’s there, and then they boil it all up and render it down into fishmeal and oil which is fed to fish and shrimps in fish farms.</p><p>“It’s converting the wild into the domestic in an incredibly destructive way.”</p><p>Some 300,000 whales and dolphins are killed every year as bycatch, including some 10,000 dolphins off the Atlantic coast of France – around 10 times as many as those purposefully killed in Taiji, according to Sea Shepherd.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644403917.jpg><p>Even those fisheries labelled sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) have been found to massacre huge numbers of porpoises, seabirds and other animals as bycatch.</p><p>Seaspiracy alleges that the MSC makes the majority of its money from licensing its blue tick sustainable status to fisheries, and that it's not practical for governments to enforce sustainable fishing policies on the estimated 4.6million fishing vessels at sea around the world.</p><p>In other words, the consumer has no way of knowing how "sustainable" the seafood they buy really is, no matter what the label says.</p><p>George Clark, MSC Programme Director, UK & Ireland, said: "The portrayal of sustainable fishing and MSC in 'Seaspiracy' is misleading. We’re very proud of MSC certified UK fishers who are championing sustainable fishing.</p><p>"This takes incredible commitment and it's really important to recognise the role the fishing industry has played in ensuring that there is fish for our future and to support them by looking for sustainable seafood products.</p><p>"Despite the film’s portrayal, it is important to realise that fisheries certified to the MSC standard are required to manage their environmental impact, including minimising bycatch of protected species.</p><p>"Those that do not can be suspended from the MSC programme. Moreover, the MSC is not a commercial enterprise but a not-for-profit and licensing income comes from use of the blue label on products and not from the certification of fisheries directly. Consumers who choose the MSC-labelled products, are helping conserve our oceans for future generations."</p><h2>Plastic apocalypse</h2><p>But even the nets themselves used by commercial fishing vessels are a disaster.</p><p>In the Great Pacific garbage patch – a 1.6million square kilometre region of ocean filled with waste – 46 per cent of the rubbish is made up of fishing nets and other fishing gear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000394090600.jpg><p>Enough longline fishing lines are set every day to wrap around the circumference of the globe 500 times.</p><p>Yet much of the moral panic about about ocean pollution has been on plastic straws – which actually account for just 0.03 per cent of plastic in the ocean.</p><p>According to the documentary, fishing gear is the real disaster, and even wreaks havoc before it's discarded, with heavy trawler nets pulverising all in their paths as they're dragged along seabeds.</p><p>When such destruction happens on land, we're horrified – but that destruction is utterly eclipsed by what's happening beneath the waves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000642130617-1.jpg><p>Around 25million acres of land is deforested every year, which is roughly 27 football pitches a minute.</p><p>By contrast, bottom trawling wipes out 3.9billion acres every year, or 4,316 football pitches a minute.</p><p>That's an area the size of Greenland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Turkey, Iran, Thailand, and Australia combined being destroyed every year.</p><h2>Dead people kept in freezers</h2><p>Before we can even reach a cataclysmic collapse of global fisheries, lives are already being destroyed by the global demand for fish.</p><p>Tabrizi speaks to people forced into slavery on Thai fishing vessels, where 51,000 boats compete for dwindling fish stocks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000644401672.jpg><p>"They had to find a way of fishing evermore cheaply to catch fewer fish," says Steve Trent of the Environmental Justice Foundation.</p><p>"That's where the inherent vulnerability begins. Most of those boats would not be economic without this free, cheap labour."</p><p>Some people enslaved are forced to work for years under the threat of violence or even death.</p><p>"I was so depressed I tried to take my own life three times,” one former enslaved fisherman says, adding the captain would scald the crew with boiling water and even threaten them with a gun.</p><p>A lot of the seafood we’re consuming today is from slavery, from forced labour.</p><span class=quote-credit>Survivor of fishing slavery</span><p>“On the ship I was on, sometimes they kept dead human bodies in the freezers after killing them.”</p><p>Despite slavery in commercial fishing being a massive issue, some of those forced to work for nothing feel like the world doesn't care about their plight.</p><p>"People don’t see how we catch seafood, they only care for consumption," one says in Seaspiracy.</p><p>"A lot of the seafood we’re consuming today is from slavery, from forced labour.</p><p>"I would like to see everyone stop supporting them if that’s possible.”</p><h2>Lice-infested salmon</h2><p>Problems from eating seafood can even be found here in the UK.</p><p>Seaspiracy shows Scottish salmon being in cramped fish farms – half of all of the world's food comes from farms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-29-at-17.35.59.png><p>The problem is that farms require more fish to make their feed than the farms can produce, according to the documentary, though salmon producers dispute this.</p><p>One estimate also claims that Scottish salmon farms create as much organic waste as the population of Scotland each year.</p><p>The Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO) says there isn't sufficient data to support this.</p><p>It also disputes the way Seaspiracy presents the farms as cramped and filthy, with salmon dying from anaemia, lice, and even chlamydia.</p><p>It's not yet known exactly how the bacterial infection is transmitted between the fish, but infected salmon develop cysts in their gills which can lead to respiratory distress and death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-29-at-17.35.41.png><p>Despite fears about the future of our oceans, some experts in Seaspiracy believe individuals can make a difference – stop eating seafood.</p><p>Prof Roberts takes a more nuanced view, pointing out that seafood is vital for people in developing countries.</p><p>"Giving it up is not really an option for them," he says.
