In fact, she rose to fame during the 80s thanks to appearing in a string of successful movies that helped make her a star of the decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1984, Shue’s big break would come in&nbsp;The Karate Kid, which proved to be a huge success for the performer. The film went on to spawn an entire franchise of films and a subsequent show decades later, but during the 80s, Shue only appeared in the first film. Coincidentally, that same year, the actress would also star on the show&nbsp;Call to Glory, which lasted for just a single season.</p><p>In 1987, Shue would once again strike gold on the big screen thanks to starring in the film&nbsp;Adventures in Babysitting. It wasn’t as big of a hit as&nbsp;The Karate Kid, but it was still a solid success for the actress. She would then go on to star in one of Tom Cruise’s earliest hits,&nbsp;Cocktail.</p><p>In 1989, Shue landed a role in the&nbsp;Back to the Future&nbsp;franchise in&nbsp;Part II and&nbsp;Part III, ending the decade and kicking off the 90s in style. Thanks to a string of successful films, she was a popular actress who had a ton to look forward to. Naturally, all of these movies went into expanding her net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Behind The Scenes Pics Of ‘The Boys’ Cast That Change Everything</a></span></p><h2 id=she-went-on-to-star-in-csi>She Went On To Star In CSI</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/F0958561-A757-48EE-9920-5A0BE40D0D9C.jpeg><p>During the 90s, things would cool off a bit for the actress. It seemed like she simply couldn’t miss in the 80s, but her projects weren’t as successful in the 90s. However, the actress delivered a stellar performance and was nominated for an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Academy Award</a> for her performance in 1995’s&nbsp;Leaving Las Vegas. This was a huge boost to her career during that time.</p><p>Through the years, Shue would steadily act in movie projects, but these projects came with a mixed degree of success. Sure, films like&nbsp;Hollow Man and even&nbsp;Piranha 3D were successful, but there were other projects that didn’t quite pan out. She would have some work on television, but her primary work had been on the big&nbsp;screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2012, she wound up taking her net worth to another level by landing a role on&nbsp;CSI. Despite her biggest and best work being in film, the transition to television wound up being a wise move for the actress. By the time Shue came on board, CSI&nbsp;was a mainstay on the small screen with an established legacy, and Shue’s inclusion on the show proved to be a success. The actress would appear on the show for over 70 episodes, undoubtedly pocketing a nice salary for her efforts.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘The Boys’: Which Star Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=she-was-recently-on-the-boys>She Was Recently On The Boys</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1BC447FC-F13A-4BEA-A0A9-6D64012D325E.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In continuing with her newfound success on television and lining her pockets while doing so, Shue was able to secure the role of the villainous Madelyn Stillwell on The Boys. She was brilliant on both seasons of the show, and this helped younger fans see what she could do in a huge role.</p><p>Not only has Shue thrived on&nbsp;The Boys, but the performer has also made a return to the&nbsp;Karate Kid franchise, much to the delight of fans. She guest-starred on 2 episodes of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cobra Kai</a>, which was the first time that she had taken part in the franchise since the 80s. It’s pretty incredible to see how popular the show has become, and bringing Shue on board was genius by the producers.</p><p>As it stands now, Shue has a series called&nbsp;On the Verge in the works. She will now have the opportunity to anchor her own show and make bank while doing so. This could take her net worth to another level, and it can also give her a fresh starring vehicle while still making appearances in other projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">William Zabka and Ralph Macchio Break Down The ‘Cobra Kai’ Ali Reunion Scene</a></span></p><p>After becoming a star in the '80s and maintaining her success, Elisabeth Shue has amassed an impressive net worth.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drew Barrymore Talks Being Hooked On Netflix Series ‘Cobra Kai’</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLyjvsBmopqhXajBor6MnqOiq5GXsrW0jKyfrp1dlrqiv9Kem2aglad6cn6MbmSmoZyhtrC6jKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-cobra-kai-star-elisabeth-shue-amassed-her-12-5-million-net-worth.html&text=How%20%27Cobra%20Kai%27%20Star%20Elisabeth%20Shue%20Amassed%20Her%20%2412.5%20Million%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-cobra-kai-star-elisabeth-shue-amassed-her-12-5-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-cobra-kai-star-elisabeth-shue-amassed-her-12-5-million-net-worth.html&title=How%20%27Cobra%20Kai%27%20Star%20Elisabeth%20Shue%20Amassed%20Her%20%2412.5%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-cobra-kai-star-elisabeth-shue-amassed-her-12-5-million-net-worth.html&title=How%20%27Cobra%20Kai%27%20Star%20Elisabeth%20Shue%20Amassed%20Her%20%2412.5%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-cobra-kai-star-elisabeth-shue-amassed-her-12-5-million-net-worth.html&title=How%20%27Cobra%20Kai%27%20Star%20Elisabeth%20Shue%20Amassed%20Her%20%2412.5%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-cobra-kai-star-elisabeth-shue-amassed-her-12-5-million-net-worth.html&description=How%20%27Cobra%20Kai%27%20Star%20Elisabeth%20Shue%20Amassed%20Her%20%2412.5%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-zaire-wade-gay-everything-to-know-about-him.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Zaire Wade Gay?
