Sandy was matched with the Gold Coast tycoon <a href=#>Dan Hunjas</a> by the show’s experts, John Aiken, Mel Schilling, and sexologist Alessandra Rampolla.</p><p>In the wiki article below, get to know if Sandy and Dan are still together in 2023. Also, find out details about Sandy’s age, job, family, and more.</p><h3><strong>MAFS Australia: Are Sandy Jawanda And Dan Hunjas Still Together?</strong></h3><p>MAFS Australia Season 10 premiered on Channel 9 on January 2023 and saw 10 new couples meet each other for the first time at the altar. The way MAFS works, the future episodes of the show will see couples embark on a honeymoon before deciding whether to continue their relationship or not by attending a commitment ceremony every week.</p><p>Besides Sandy Jawanda and Dan Hunjas, the other 9 couples of MAFS Australia Season 10 are Harrison Boon and Bronte Schofield, Cameroon Woods, and Lyndall Grace, Jesse Burford and Claire Nomarhas, Oliver Skelton and Tahnee Cook, Adam Seed and Janelle Han, Shannon Adams, and Caitlin McConville, Duncan James and Alyssa Barmonde, Joshua White and Melissa Sheppard, and Layton Mills and Melinda Willis.</p><p>As per Sandy’s profile on 9 now, Sandy, who grew up in an Indian household in Australia, had little to no exposure to the opposite sex as she “was not allowed to mix with boys and had no male friends.”</p><p>Now, in her mid-30s, Sandy has never been in any serious relationship. She struggles with insecurities that come with the lack of dating experience. Now, she wants to fast-track her experience with someone that can respect her boundaries and she has full faith in MAFS experts that they have found the perfect man for her.</p><p>Sandy’s nuptials to Dan was undeniably unique. Seeing the bride walking down the aisle in a red lehenga, exchanging flower garlands with her groom at the altar, and dancing to Punjabi music was a rare moment for all the viewers.</p><p>“While it’s not unusual to have an arranged marriage in Indian culture, the difference is that the pool of people that my parents are choosing from is very different to what the experts are looking at, which is a much bigger pool,” Sandy told Refinery29 Australia.</p><p>While the beautiful Indian wedding mesmerized all the viewers, Dan’s wedding guests’ controversial comments about the wedding left the Internet with no choice other than to slam them online.</p><p>As Dan’s guests entered the hall, one said that the decoration was “over the top,” while another pair of women attempted to guess Sandy’s ethnicity. “This is not at all what I expected. It’s got to be like Thai or like Indian or something,” they said.</p><p>Commenting on these controversial remarks, one Twitter user wrote, “I hope Dan’s shitty mates are sitting at home, watching this and are cringing! Bonus points to the show for showcasing their shit behavior to the nation. #MAFS #MAFSAU”</p><p>After the wedding, Sandy revealed that she felt “exposed and vulnerable” by showcasing her culture.</p><p>Contrary to his friends’ behavior at the nuptials, Dan seemed genuinely excited to meet Sandy, helping put her at ease during the whole ceremony. While we don’t if the two are still together in February 2023, Sandy and Dan definitely had some connection during their first meeting itself.</p><p>To talk a little about Dan Hunjas, he is the CEO of Edge Marketing, an advertising agency located in Burleigh Heads, Queensland. Before starting his business, he worked in marketing and acquisition in the childcare sector. Furthermore, Dan, who has teased on his Instagram page that he has a “tequila bar opening soon”, also lent his talents to brands during the 2000 Sydney Olympics.</p><h3><strong>Sandy Jawanda Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1986, Sandy Jawanda’s age was 37 at the time of this writing.</p><h3><strong>Sandy Jawanda Family</strong></h3><p>Sandy grew up as a first-gen Indian in the 90s in Australia, which was challenging for her.</p><p>Talking about her family, the MAFS star had an emotional breakdown on Tuesday’s (31 Jan) episode after her Indian parents threatened to disown her for being part of the dating show.</p><p>After Sandy broke the news to her parents, they refused to let the MAFS camera crew enter their home. “My dad was saying that he just can’t accept this decision, mum’s like, “why is she doing this to us?” I just felt so bad when mum was like, “if she’s gonna do this we don’t want anything to do with her,” Sandy told.</p><p>Although her parents did not join her, Sandy was surrounded by her friends and siblings during the nuptials.</p><p>Sandy is the oldest of three sisters.
