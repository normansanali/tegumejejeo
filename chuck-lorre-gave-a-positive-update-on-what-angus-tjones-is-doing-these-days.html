It’s an extraordinary thing. We started working together, he was eight years old. He’s a little boy, right? With just uncanny comedic instincts, without thinking. It was just in his DNA. And to work together again, 20 years later, we had fun. It was a wonderful afternoon. Everybody had the same reaction: ‘Oh my God. You’re a grown man!'”</p><p>As for what he's doing, Lorre didn't get into specifics, but revealed the former child star is working on things outside of Hollywood.</p><p>"Conversations with Angus would lead me to say no, he's done," he shared.

And there was a lot of gratitude. I think it was warm. People said it must have been healing and you know, it was. It was wonderful to not just give the man a hug. We worked together and we had a blast.
